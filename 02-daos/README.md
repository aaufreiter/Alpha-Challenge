# DAOs - Tier 1
You’re a DeFi enthusiast who spends a lot of time participating in and analyzing DAOs, their governance contracts, and their overall level of participation. Over the past couple of years, the market has slowed down and you’ve begun to notice that some DAOs are not the same as they used to be.


- a) Identify a set of DAOs that are most vulnerable to an economic governance attack, describe how it may be achieved, and estimate the cost to the attacker.

  Characteristics of Vulnerable DAOs

  I. Low Governance Token Liquidity
  
    If a DAO’s gov token has thin liquidity, the attacker can relatively quickly buy up a controlling stake - % depends on the DAO - without incurring astronomical slippage. While low liquidity may usually lead to large buy orders wiping out the order book or push deeply through the AMM curve (-> significant slippage), an attacker might still get away with it if they are the only large buyer, there is a bear market and people are happy to sell and the buys might be disguised (OTC, accumulation over time etc.).

  II. High Treasury-to-Market-Cap Ratio
  
    In case a DAO’s on-chain treasury is significantly larger than its gov token’s MC or fully diluted value, a malicious actor could buy up enough tokens to pass a proposal, which relocates the treasury funds or they may change parameters of the DAO structure in a way that is profitable to them.
  
  III. Inactive or Under-Engaged Community
  
    DAOs suffering from “governance fatigue”, where large token holders or the community don't actively vote (anymore) are more likely to be overtaken by a determined attacker. Depending in the requirements for a proposal to pass, low voter turnout may drastically reduce the threshold required for passing malicious proposals.
  
  IV. Straight Token-Based Voting With No Safety Mechanisms
  
    Some DAOs do not have time locks, quorum requirements, or safeguards that prevent quick passage of proposals. These governance systems might be easily exploitable.

  Example: SILO DAO
  SILO DAO exhibits characteristics of vulnerability due to its governance token ($SILO) having relatively low liquidity, with a 24-hour TVol of only $224,972 and a MC of $17.65M. Given the governance quorum of 10M SILO (approximately 2.85% of the circulating supply), an attacker could accumulate the necessary tokens to pass a proposal at a relatively low cost. At a price of ~$0.0503 per token, acquiring 10M SILO would cost approximately $503,000 (excluding slippage).

    The treasury of SILO DAO holds $71.42M in TVL. This is significantly higher than its MC of $17.65M (01.01.2025, 2100 UTC+1). This creates an imbalance where a malicious actor could potentially spend $503,000 to control proposals and access funds worth over $71M. 

- b) For vulnerable DAOs, estimate and describe the potential benefit for the attacker i.e., how much of the DAO’s treasury is at risk of being stolen? (it can also be a parameter change)

  I. Treasury Draining via a "ecosystem development" Proposal
  An attacker could submit a proposal under the guise of "ecosystem development" to allocate a portion of the treasury to a wallet they control. For instance, a proposal might suggest transferring significant portion of the treasury funds for liquidity mining rewards, partnerships, or marketing campaigns. The attacker, through careful wording, could direct these funds to a fraudulent smart contract or an attacker-controlled wallet.The concret amount at risk is hard to dicern, since an amount that is too high could garner unwanted interest. 

2. Collateral Manipulation to Over-Leverage the Protocol
An attacker could propose changes to collateral factors, reducing the required collateralization for loans. For example:

Current Collateral Factor: 1.5x (150%)
Proposed Collateral Factor: 1.1x (110%)
Once the proposal is enacted:

The attacker deposits low-value collateral (e.g., $1M worth of illiquid tokens).
With the reduced collateral factor, they can borrow up to $9M in stablecoins or high-value assets like ETH or BTC.
They withdraw the borrowed funds, leaving the protocol exposed to $8M in bad debt when the collateral is insufficient to cover the loans.
3. Fee Redirection to an Attacker-Controlled Wallet
The attacker could exploit the DAO's fee distribution mechanisms. For instance, they might propose redirecting 50% of protocol fees (generated by borrowing, lending, or transaction activities) to a new "Development Fund" controlled by the attacker. Over time, this could drain millions of dollars from the protocol without requiring direct access to the treasury.

Given SILO DAO's Total Value Locked (TVL) of $71.42M, even a modest 1% fee on all transactions routed to the attacker-controlled address could amount to $714,200 annually. This would provide the attacker with a steady stream of income, making the exploit long-term and less noticeable.
